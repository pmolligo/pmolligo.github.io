Three measures of TPU are constructed using newspaper coverage, firms' earnings calls, and tariff rates. Firm-level and aggregate macroeconomic data reveal that increases in TPU reduce business investment. The empirical results are interpreted through the lens of a two-country general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities and firms' export participation decisions. News and increased uncertainty about higher future tariffs reduce investment and activity."}],"references":[{"name":"Professor Dora Costa (UCLA Economics)"},{"name":"Professor Martha Bailey (UCLA Economics)"}]}
