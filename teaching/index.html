It was incredibly easy to follow very complicated topics… his explanatory skills and section were invaluable to the overall course.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>I have never had a better TA. Patrick is the most attentive, intelligent, and responsive TA. He genuinely cares so much about us and never made any of our questions feel insignificant.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Patrick was beyond helpful, caring, and extremely knowledgeable of the class. At some points, I think he taught the material better than the professor.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>He has a gift when it comes to explaining difficult topics. Patrick deserves recognition for his hard work, time, effort, and knowledge of the subject.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Patrick was excellent at presenting information and clarifying any confusion along the way. He really made sure his students understood the material and how to apply it.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>He always went above and beyond to make sure students understood and felt capable of the difficult material.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Patrick was very responsive to emails, which aided my understanding greatly. His sections and office hours were very helpful, and he is just overall a great person.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>He livestreamed and recorded sections on Zoom, added additional office hours, and hosted exam review sessions outside of class time. Patrick cares deeply about his students.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>He was extremely welcoming and open during office hours and helped me with project questions or any questions about the content itself.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Patrick was always prepared for section and provided many examples that helped to expand on the material.

Whenever someone had a question, he answered it thoughtfully and clearly.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>He was very detailed in explaining concepts — far more precise and detailed than the professor.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>Really good at giving students everything they need, providing lots of learning material. Very strong overall!</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>This professor was always super welcoming and made asking questions seem not so intimidating. Patrick would never make a student feel stupid or dumb if they didn’t understand the concept the first time.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>Patrick’s strengths are his ability to bring a class of 70 students together and ensure that they receive as much value as possible. He always answered any questions and cleared up all confusion.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>He was flexible and always ready to set up extra office hours or meetings whenever I needed help.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>I am simply obsessed with Patrick. He was one of, if not the best, TAs I’ve had at UCLA. He made everything make so much sense and really calmed everybody down after each lecture.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>Patrick did an amazing job and genuinely cared for his students. I hope I can be a student in his TA section once again.</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Patrick A.
