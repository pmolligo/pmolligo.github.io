abstract    ={This paper examines the understudied role of vocational education in the U.S. by measuring the effects of training subsidies established by the World War II and Korean War G.I. Bills. While previous research emphasizes gains in college and high school attainment, I show that these programs also substantially expanded vocational training. Leveraging birth cohort variation in military service as an exogenous source of eligibility, I estimate that G.I. Bill benefits increased vocational school completion by 4–9\% for WWII veterans and 3–7\% for Korean War veterans, with stronger effects in the South and among older workers. This paper is the first empirical study of trade school in the context of the G.I. Bill and the first to use this setting to model the rich set of education choices faced by veterans. While most vocational school completers in the sample have a high school education or lower, results suggest there were marginal workers whom the subsidies shifted into either trade school or college.}

  abstract    ={This paper studies the effects of unexpected changes in trade policy uncertainty (TPU) on the U.S. economy. Three measures of TPU are constructed using newspaper coverage, firms' earnings calls, and tariff rates. Firm-level and aggregate macroeconomic data reveal that increases in TPU reduce business investment. The empirical results are interpreted through the lens of a two-country general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities and firms' export participation decisions. News and increased uncertainty about higher future tariffs reduce investment and activity.}
