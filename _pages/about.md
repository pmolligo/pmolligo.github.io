I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at UCLA, specializing in applied microeconomics with a focus on labor and economic history. My research examines the development of vocational education in the United States over the past century. I use causal inference and historical data methods to measure how U.S. policies have shaped access to and returns from non-college training pathways. My dissertation centers on the G.I. Bill—the first national program to subsidize individual trade-school enrollment—and the resulting shifts in educational choice, labor market outcomes, and racial disparities.
